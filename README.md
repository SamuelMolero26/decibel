# decibel Meter

Fun project that started as funny/silly way for my roomate and I to finally determine who can whistle the loudess. 
The idea came from Him and I just on the overall excution (AKA on coding it)

Hope you can enjoy it and potentially prove who has the loudest whistle among your peers :)
