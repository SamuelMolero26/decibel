# Decibel Meter

A fun and purely for entertainment purposes project that started as a funny/silly way for my roommate and me to finally determine who could whistle the loudest. 
The idea came from Him and I just on the overall execution (AKA on coding it)

I hope you can enjoy it and potentially prove who has the loudest whistle among your peers :)
