# Decibel Meter

A fun and purely for entertainment purposes project that started as a funny/silly way for my roommate and me to finally determine who could whistle the loudest. 
The idea came from Him and I just on the overall execution (AKA I coded the entire thing)

I hope you can enjoy it and potentially prove who has the loudest whistle among your peers :)


PD: I don't want people to think my roommate is lazy or something, He is just a Mechanical Engineer and obviously doesn't have much coding experience, but he is a very smart guy.
